SmartGist aims to generate a PDF containing all relevant information related to each
topic contained in an input PDF provided by the user.The subtopics are identified within
the input PDF and extracted using keyword extraction methods. Then these identified
subtopics are searched for in the other reference materials provided by the user.The contents under each subtopic is gathered for summarization.A new PDF is generated withthe summarized content.This application aggregates summarized content from specified
reference materials making it easy for users.They can avoid referencing multiple reference
materials simultaneously.The app employs advanced natural language processing (NLP)
techniques to identify and extract subtopics,employs cross document search,summarizes
the content and generates a new PDF.The summarized PDF serves as a consolidated
resource, eliminating the need to manually sift through multiple documents.The app provides a user-friendly interface for users to upload and select PDF documents
